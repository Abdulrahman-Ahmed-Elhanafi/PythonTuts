Code Fast Learn Fast
====================

In the past months, I have been delivering machine learning courses online. These courses focus on both theory and practice. I cannot say that are not efficient but it takes quite some time. Thus, I wanted to change the way of presenting my lectures, so I came up with an idea, which I like to call **Code Fast Learn Fast**.

## How Code Fast Learn Fast works:
  1. It focuses on writing codes more than theory. 
  2. It depends upon real world data to solve ML and AI problems.
  3. It uses the state-of-the-art technology such as XGBoost, Neural Networks, catboost, sklearn.
  4. Mainly, the language would be python
