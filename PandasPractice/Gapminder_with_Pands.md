Analysing Gapminder Data set:
---

Gapminder tracks economic and social indicators like population, life expectancy and the GDP per capita of countries over time. For more information about Gapminder, visit the this [link](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)

I believe that __learning by doing__ is the best way to level up the analytical skills, so I feel the need to present this project.

The goal of this small project is to learn:

  - Data Wrangling with Python: 
       - Selecting and filtering.
       - Creating new variables
       - Sorting
       - Grouping and aggregating
       - Calculating Summary Statistics
  - Data visualization 
    -  The types of plots
    -  Visual analytics
    -  Plotting by groups
    -  ...


Toots for this project:
---

  1. Python jupyter notebook
  2. Pandas 
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Seaborn


**The project will be later analyzed using R, SAS, STATA, Excel .... ** 

**The results will be shared later**
