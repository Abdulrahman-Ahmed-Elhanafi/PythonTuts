    "## What is Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Virtual Environment is used to create a container or isolated environment where the Python-related dependencies are installed for a specific project. One can work with many different versions of Python with its various packages.\n",

    "### Creating Virtual Environment with Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In order to create virtual environment, it is better to use **Anaconda Prompt**. If you are on windows, press the **Windows icon** in the lower corner of the screen to open the **Search box**, then Type **Anaconda Prompt** or just the first few letters, the results will appear, then use the mouse pointer to launch it, or write it fully and press enter to open it. Linux or Mac users can use the **terminal**. \n",

    "  - Creating a virtual environment is easy, which take only few few steps, (don't get scared about the name, nothing special about it, and once you started using it, you will love it, and many of your problems will be solved by using **this trick**), here are the steps:\n",
    "      1. Create a virtual evironment, try to choose a name that makes sense for you and for your project.\n",
    "      2. Activate the specific virtual environment that you want to use. \n",
    "      3. Install the packages you need for your project, even with required version. (Remember, you cannot import packages installed on the system once activating the virtual environment).\n",
    "      4. Once done your work, deactivate your virtual environment to go back to your base system, or to activate another virtual environment. \n",
